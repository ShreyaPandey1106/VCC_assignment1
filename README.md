# VCC_assignment1

This repository contains the Python microservices developed for VCC assignment 1.

## Description

This project implements two microservices, `service.py` and `service2.py`, using Python and the Flask framework.  These services are designed to [briefly describe the purpose of the microservices - what they do].

## Requirements

Before running the services, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3:**  Python 3 is required. You can check your Python version by running `python3 --version`.
*   **pip:** The Python package installer.  It's usually included with Python 3. You can check if it's installed by running `pip3 --version`.
*   **Flask:** The Flask web framework.  Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip3 install Flask
    ```

## Running the Services

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ShreyaPandey1106/VCC_assignment1.git](https://github.com/ShreyaPandey1106/VCC_assignment1.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd VCC_assignment1
    ```

3.  **Run each service in a separate terminal:**

    For `service.py`:

    ```bash
    python3 service.py
    ```

    For `service2.py`:

    ```bash
    python3 service2.py
    ```

   For example:  "Service 1 runs on port 5000, and Service 2 runs on port 5001."

## Usage

These services are used to connect two VMs.
